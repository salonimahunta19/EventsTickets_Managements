The EventsTickets_Managements System is a Laravel-powered application designed to streamline the complete lifecycle of event creation, ticket distribution, and booking management. This project focuses on providing an intuitive and robust interface for both event organizers and attendees. Laravel’s framework ensures clean code, secure routing, and efficient database handling.

Organizers can create unlimited events by defining event titles, descriptions, schedules, venues, ticket categories, pricing, and seat availability. Once published, events appear on the public dashboard for users to browse. The system supports multiple ticket types (VIP, General, Early Bird, Student Pass, etc.), giving flexibility for different pricing strategies.

Users can explore ongoing or upcoming events, view detailed event descriptions, and instantly book tickets. The booking module ensures secure ticket reservations and generates unique ticket IDs for verification. The system supports QR-code ticket validation, enabling fast check-in at physical event gates.

Admin functionalities include event management, ticket monitoring, user management, payment verification, attendee list export, and visual analytics. Laravel’s blade templates enhance UI consistency, while Eloquent ORM ensures structured and optimized database queries.

Additional features include email notifications, automated ticket generation, booking history, and a responsive UI for desktop and mobile screens. With Laravel’s security features, the system prevents common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, CSRF, and unauthorized access.

This project serves as an excellent solution for institutions, companies, and event organizers looking for a professional, digitized ticket management system.
